    <h1>project A: Cyberpond Ecosystem</h1>
    <h3><em>Digital water life inhabiting in a cyber world</em></h3>
    <h2>The Elevator Pitch.</h2>
    <p>Cyberpond Ecosystem revolves around exploring various creatures inhabiting in a tiny cyber pond. It simulates a school of fish gracefully navigating the pond’s water, with their predator chasing all the way behind.</p>
    <h2>Abstract.</h2>
    <p> Within the Cyberpond Ecosystem,  the school of fish exhibit a range of interactive behaviors with the predator. Users are empowered to interact with these creatures using their mouse, aiming to reflect how human intervention can disrupt the delicate equilibrium of nature’s complicated operations. The core objective of this project is to provoke contemplation about ecosystems through a virtual experience, emphasizing the interconnectedness of life within nature. It serves as a reminder that every organism plays a role in sustaining the stability of an ecosystem, and any alteration has the potential to reverberate throughout the entire system.</p>
